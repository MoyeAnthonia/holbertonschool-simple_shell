.TH HSH 1 "December 2025" "Simple Shell" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
hsh \- a simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimal UNIX command line interpreter implemented in C.
It reads command lines from standard input and executes programs
using
.BR fork (2)
and
.BR execve (2).

The shell supports execution of external commands, argument parsing,
searching executable files using the
.B PATH
environment variable, and a limited set of built-in commands.

The shell operates in both interactive mode (with a prompt) and
non-interactive mode (reading from standard input).

.SH FEATURES
.TP
\- Displays a prompt when running interactively
.TP
\- Executes external programs using absolute paths or PATH lookup
.TP
\- Handles command-line arguments
.TP
\- Prints appropriate error messages when commands are not found
.TP
\- Returns correct exit status codes for executed commands

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.
The shell exits using the status of the last executed command.
No arguments are supported.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment, one variable per line.

.SH USAGE
Run the shell interactively:
.PP
.nf
$ ./hsh
$ ls -l
$ /bin/ls
$ env
$ exit
.fi

Run the shell non-interactively:
.PP
.nf
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
.fi

.SH RETURN VALUE
The shell exits with the status of the last executed command.
If a command is not found, an exit status of 127 is returned.

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If a command cannot be found, an error message is printed to standard error
in the following format:
.PP
.nf
program_name: command_number: command: not found
.fi

The shell does not fork if a command does not exist.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
Used to locate executable commands when no slash (/) is present in the command.
.TP
.B environ
Used internally to pass the environment to executed programs.

.SH LIMITATIONS

.PP
\- Pipes
.br
\- Redirections
.br
\- Job control
.br
\- Command chaining
